A student can enroll his chosen class with the chosen faculty and the teaching takes place into the Application itself, so that the student can learn from anywhere and the teacher can teach remotely. It's an excellent tool for distance learning.

                    Jul 2016 – Oct 2016: &nbsp;
                    The idea behind Urban Chefs stems from the frustrating question, that each office worker in the UAE is asking herself/himself or around, on a daily basis : "What am I going to have for lunch?" As former office workers, we really understand this issue, that we ourselves faced through different forms: what cuisine, what dish, what restaurant, How long before it gets delivered (if they actually respect it) will have I to sell a kidney to afford my lunch? (Sigh)... All those questions can easily turn the highest point of our daily life in the office, into a nightmare.

                    It had to stop.

                    Urban Chefs is the answer to all our lunch-at-the office prayers. (in orange)

                    Each member of the team understands the importance of simplifying the lunch experience at the office and possesses a very high degree of empathy. Jamil is obsessed with the glass half full, with the elegance of the manners that his heritage from Uganda imposes him; Amro takes pride and joy in making you smile, that's probably the Italian style in action; and Mehdi.. Well, why don't you figure it out by yourself, how the French touch will impact your life. The rest of team will derive inspiration from its Emirati, Lebanese, Bengali culture and heritage to deliver to you the #UC spirit (in orange). UAE at its finest...

                    Time to reclaim Lunch time at the office!!
